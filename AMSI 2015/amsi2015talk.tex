\begin{frame}{The spaces}
\begin{itemize}
\item A torus is a doughnut.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=50mm,scale=0.1]{simpsons-donut.png}
\end{center}
\item A 3-sphere $\S^4$ is unit sphere in $\R^4$ or $\C^2$. For us, we will think of it as $SU(2)$, which looks like
\[
\begin{pmatrix} α & -\bar{β} \\ β & \bar{α} \end{pmatrix},\text{ with } α\bar{α} + β\bar{β} = 1
\]
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Harmonic Map}
\begin{itemize}
\item Let $f : T^2 \to SU(2)$. Use $f$ to pull pack the connection on $SU(2)$ to get a connection $A$. Automatically we have $d_A (df) = 0$.
\item A harmonic map is one that minimises the energy. It must satisfy $d_A^* (df) = 0$.
\item Translate the values of $df$ so it is a map to the Lie algebra, and split it up as $\tfrac{1}{2} f^{-1} df = Φ - Φ^*$.
\item We can then rearrange our two equations to be about $A$ and $Φ$.
\[
d^{''}_A Φ = 0,\qquad\qquad F_A = [Φ,Φ^*]
\]
$Φ$ is called the Higgs field.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Family of Flat Connections}
\begin{itemize}
\item Given a pair $(Φ,A)$, we can make a family of connections in the following way. Let $ζ\in\C^\times$ and define
\[
\nabla_ζ := \nabla_A + ζ^{-1}Φ - ζ Φ^*
\]
\item Every connection in this family is flat (zero curvature) since
\[
F = (d_A + ζ^{-1}Φ - ζΦ^*)^2 = d_A^2 - [Φ,Φ^*] = 0
\]
\item The connections are $SL(2,\C)$ valued. When $ζ=1,-1$ the result is the left and right connections on $SU(2)$
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Holonomy}
\begin{itemize}
\item Because the connections are flat, we can define holonomy for them. Pick a base point, and take two loops around the torus.
\item Parallel translating a vector with $\nabla_ζ$ around one loop gives a linear map the vector space at the base point. Call this $H(ζ)$. Around the other loop call the transformation $\tilde H(ζ)$.
\item With some analysis and the fact that these two matrices commute (because the fundamental group of the torus is abelian), one can show that $(\tr H)^2 - 4$ (a function in $ζ$) vanishes to odd order only finitely many times.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Spectral Curve}
\begin{itemize}
\item The eigenvalues of $H(ζ)$ are $μ(ζ), μ(ζ)^{-1}$. The characteristic polynomial is
\[
μ^2 - (\tr H) μ + 1 = 0
\]
\item What we want to do is to build a curve over $ζ\in\C^\times$ where $μ$ is single valued.
\item We can use the characteristic equation to define a two sheeted cover of $\C^\times$ with finite branching.
\item Looking at the behaviour of $μ$ as $ζ\to 0$ (ditto $ζ\to\infty$), we can fill in the missing points to make a two sheeted cover $Σ$ of $\CP^1$, called the spectral curve.
\item It is an algebraic curve, with several nice additional structures.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{The Differentials}
\begin{itemize}
\item The spectral curve provides a natural setting to talk about the eigenvalues, but they are not so nice themselves.
\item However, $\log μ, \log \tilde {μ}$ are holomorphic on $\C^\times$, have simple poles above $ζ=0,\infty$ and nowhere else, but are only locally defined.
\item $d \log μ$ removes the additive ambiguity of $\log$. Thus we consider a pair of meromorphic differentials $Θ = d \log μ, \tilde {Θ} = \log \tilde {μ}$, which have residue free double poles over $ζ=0,\infty$.
\item In order for the eigenvalues to be well defined, one requires that the periods of the differentials lie in $2π\iu\Z$.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Spectral Data}
\begin{itemize}
\item We now have a curve $Σ$ and a pair of differentials $Θ,\tilde{Θ}$. There is one more piece of information needed: a line bundle.
\item Then a theorem of Hitchin gives conditions for such data to correspond to a harmonic map.
\item An important part of this result is that for fixed $(Σ,Θ,\tilde{Θ})$ we can choose from many line bundles. These are called isospectral deformations.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Genus Zero example}
\begin{itemize}
\item Take the spectral curve to be genus zero. By the various symmetric constraints, its two branch points must be a pair $α,\cji{α}$, with $α\in D$
\[
η^2 = P(ζ) = (ζ-α)(1-\bar{α}ζ)
\]
\item All differentials on it are exact, and for the $Θ$'s to have the right poles they must be of the form
\[
\log μ = (bζ^{-1} - \bar{b})η, \qquad b\in\C
\]
\item The constraints to be a harmonic map further imply that
\[
b = \frac{π}{2}\left( \frac{n}{\abs{1+α}} + \iu \frac{m}{\abs{1-α}} \right), \qquad n,m\in\Z
\]
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Moduli Space}
\begin{itemize}
\item In general, $Σ$ of genus $g$ curve can be described by $g+1$ pair of conjugate inverse points.
\item The differentials become much harder to pin down. However they must be of the form
\[
Θ = \frac{dζ}{ζ^2η} b(ζ)
\]
for some polynomials of degree $g+3$. If you just require symmetries and imaginary periods, there is a plane of differentials.
\item Whitham deformations tell us that the space of $(Σ,Θ,\tilde{Θ})$ is 2-dimensional.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
